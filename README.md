 Here is a summary of the ShapeSpawner script:

It randomly spawns cube and sphere prefabs in front of a player camera.
The prefabs, camera reference, and spawn distances are specified.
It loads color configuration data from a JSON file.
This defines possible colors for each shape type.
The spawning interval is controlled with a spawnInterval variable.
In Update(), it checks if it's time to spawn a new shape.
The shape type is chosen randomly each time.
A random color is picked from the config data for that shape.
The shape is instantiated at a random distance in front of the camera.
Its color is set based on the randomly chosen config color.
This allows procedurally spawning shapes with variations.
In summary, it spawns randomized shapes in view of the player camera, selecting color variations based on loaded configuration data.
